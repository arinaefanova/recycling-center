# Web application of the recycling center.

♻️ Recycling Center web application built for my EBC-VWA Web Applications Development course.

## Overview

As part of my university Web Applications Development course, I completed a project in which I designed and implemented a web application for a recycling center. 
The goal was to create an efficient digital platform aligned with the provided technical specifications. The application allows registered users to submit recyclable materials, 
keeping a transparent record of their contributions. I focused on implementing features such as user registration, real-time material pricing, and a user-friendly 
interface for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Key Features:

- **User Registration:** Registered users can create accounts, enabling them to submit recyclable materials and track their collection history.
- **Material Pricing:** The system calculates prices for submitted materials based on real-time catalog rates.
- **User Management:** Administrators can manage user accounts, add colleagues, and assign roles.
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface:** The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Statistics and Pricing:** Unregistered users can view material statistics and current recycling prices on the website.
